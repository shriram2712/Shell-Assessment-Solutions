Current working directory  /home/shriram/Desktop/ShellAssessment

4) Write a shell script which accepts name as input, creates a file with the accepted name (name_file.txt) & writes a sentence into the file

For e.g., if I provide input as sample, the created filename will be sample_file.txt

root@Quantiphi-928:/home/shriram/Desktop/ShellAssessment# ./q4.sh
Enter File name
s
root@Quantiphi-928:/home/shriram/Desktop/ShellAssessment# ls
q1.sh  q2.sh  q3.sh  q4.sh  s_file.txt  shell_solutions.odt  shri.txt

5) Schedule a cron job to
-> execute a script on all weekdays at 2 PM.su

Enter a number 
4
Factorial is :  24
root@Quantiphi-928:/home/shriram/Desktop/ShellAssessment# ./q6.sh
Enter a number 
1
Factorial is :  1
root@Quantiphi-928:/home/shriram/Desktop/ShellAssessment# ./q6.sh
Enter a number 
0

10 10 10
Equilateral triangle
root@Quantiphi-928:/home/shriram/Desktop/ShellAssessment# ./q7.sh
Enter the sides of the triangle
10 30 10
Isoceles 
root@Quantiphi-928:/home/shriram/Desktop/ShellAssessment# ./q7.sh
Enter the sides of the triangle
30 30 10
